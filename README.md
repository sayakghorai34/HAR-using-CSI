As I was learning about the Chanel State Information, I came across the repository and I wanted to use the dataset for my own learning purposes. I have not made any changes to the dataset. I have only added the dataset to the repository for my own learning purposes.
However, I have modified the code for my own learning purposes. As a beginner, I couldn't understood the whole thing, but I have done the model designing, fine tuning part that added up in my learning. I have added the code to the repository for my own learning purposes.


1) create a new environment = conda create -n newenv 
2) conda activate newenv
3) copy .yml file in c:/users/pcname
4) then update files on ur env from .yml file = conda env update --file environmentgpu.yml
